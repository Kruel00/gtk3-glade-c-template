This is a template GTK+ 3/Glade application.
The project is meant to be an easy starting point for any GTK+ 3 project.
Autotools and Cmake were not used because I don't know how they work.
A quirk of this project is that the XML generated by glade is used to
generate a header file, ui_xml.h, which embeds the XML in the final
executable, so that it won't have to be looked for and loaded later.
__________________________________________________________________________
To build the project, you can simply run:

	$ make
__________________________________________________________________________
To install the resulting application run as root:

	# make install
__________________________________________________________________________
The application may be uninstalled with (as root):
	
	# make uninstall
__________________________________________________________________________
You are encouraged to format your code (clang-format required) by running:

	$ make format
__________________________________________________________________________
You can clean up project files with:

	$ make clean

Tutorial Synopsis:

To get started, just write a useful C function, and in Glade, open
window_main.glade, add a useful widget, and under the signals tab,
provide the name of your function in the handler column. 

For example, you may write a function called hello_world, which 
prints "hello world" to stdout. In glade, under the control button,
add a GtkButton. In the signals tab, row "clicked", and column handler,
type the function name hello_world. Now build the project and when the
button is clicked, "hello world" is printed.

Hello World Tutorial:

Open source/main.c.
Add the following code to the top:
	 _______________________________________
	|#include <stdio.h>                     |
	|_______________________________________|

At the bottom of the file, add the following lines:
	 _______________________________________
	|void hello_world()                     |
	|{                                      |
	|    printf("Hello world!");            |
	|}                                      |
	|_______________________________________|

Now open Glade.
Click the "Control" button.
Click GtkButton, then click the blank window in the editor.

Now click on the "Signals" tab.
In the row that says "clicked", and the column labled "Handler",
type the name of our new function from main.c, hello_world.

Now from inside the root directory of this project, run:

	$ make
	$ ./build/bin/template_app

You should see "Hello world!" print in the terminal every time you
click inside the window.
